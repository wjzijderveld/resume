    I started working with symfony1 in 2010 and Symfony (2) in 2011. In 2013 I passed the Symfony Advanced Developer exam.
    With the Symfony components I can easily build anything from small libraries to full applications. And with all the
    Symfony Bundles out there, using the fullstack framework is also a great option.

  title: Debugging
  level: advanced
  description: |
    Probably a skill I learned because of my own errors, but I got told that I'm pretty fast in tracking down bugs.
    I also love using tools like XDebug with conditional breakpoints to quickly find the source of a problem.

    Git is the version control tool I prefer. Developing with your code in Git makes life that much easier. I wouldn't
    call myself an expert yet, but I definitly know my way around. I can also work with SVN and even CVS, but please don't
    ask me too.

  title: JAVA
  level: intermediate
  description: |
    In my sparetime I sometimes like to write some JAVA applications. Because it forces you to be pretty strict it helps
    me to think about solutions in a different way as I would in PHP. I usually work with Spring Framework and Maven.

    Used ElasticSearch a couple of times now with a basic setup. I really enjoyed how easy it is to setup and use.
    The possibilities are almost endless.
