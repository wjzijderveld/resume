    At Qandidate.com I ended up in a great team that helped me grow to the developer I'm now.

    I got in touch with techniques I didn't know before, like Event Sourcing for example.
    Those new techniques also got me into speaking, since then I spoke at multiple meetups and conferences.

    At Qandidate.com we hae both used Kanban and Scrum. I prefer Kanban, but both have there strengths.

    At Beeldspraak I started out as a part time junior PHP developer. I started out working in simpler sites,
    mainly with the CMS build by Beeldspraak. Within a few months I got to work on the e-commerce platform we were
    building for a big client. Part of that project was a import/export with there SAP solution with IDocs files.

    In that same project we came in touch with symfony, for me my first framework and in 2010 we went to SymfonyLive.
    In 2011 we started working with Symfony2 (in the Public Release fase) and that's when I learned a lot about abstraction
    and decoupling. With that project we also started using <a href="http://capistranorb.com/">Capistrano</a>, a
    deployment tool written in Ruby.

    Last year we started a project with <a href="https://github.com/symfony-cmf">Symfony CMF</a> and contributed to the
    project. We attended a mini-conference/hackday with a part of the CMF team in ZÃ¼rich, an experience probably won't
    forget.

    eRunner was my first actual programming job, I worked part time on various projects. It wasn't a job where I learned
    a lot, we didn't use any PHP frameworks and code quality wasn't the main priority (This changed a lot since back then).

    Since I started programming I build several websites for friends and family, some even for free. I even designed some
    sites, but I'm sure that's not my forte...
